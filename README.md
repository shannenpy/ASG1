# The Digital Zone
<p>This project is to build a website to sell digital products and services to anyone who needs them. Users can come to the website to search for templates for powerpoint, company logo and graphic design for example for a project they wish to start. If they cannot find a template to their liking, they can contact a designer through the website.</p>
<p>As owner of the site, I want to make the website easy for users to navigate through and ensure users are able to easily purchase ad download what they want, encouraging to come back again.</p>
