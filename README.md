# The Digital Zone
<!---One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.--->
<p>This project is to build a website to sell digital products and services to anyone who needs them. Users can come to the website to search for templates for powerpoint, company logo and graphic design for example for a project they wish to start. If they cannot find a template to their liking, they can contact a designer through the website.</p>
<p>As owner of the site, I want to make the website easy for users to navigate through and ensure users are able to easily purchase and download what they want. With their satistfied experience, I hope to encourage them to come back again.</p>

## Design Process
<!---Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.--->
