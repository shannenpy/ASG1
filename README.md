# The Digital Zone

<p>This project is to build a website to sell digital products and services to anyone who needs them. Users can come to the website to search for templates for powerpoint, company logo and graphic design for example for a project they wish to start. If they cannot find a template to their liking, they can contact a designer through the website to purchase their services.</p>
<p>As owner of the site, I want to make the website easy for users to navigate through and ensure users are able to easily purchase and download what they want. With their satistfied experience, I hope to encourage them to come back again.</p>

## Design Process

### User Stories

- As a owner, the catergories of template I want to put out include powerpoints, logos, icons, instagram stories and infographics, so that it will be convienient for users as they can have a one stop shop.
- As a owner, I want to source good designers, so that users can personalize their templates however they want without the constraints of the pre-designed templates.
- As a user, I want to be able to find a variety of template that is on theme for my powerpoint presentations, so that I can deliver presentable, eye-pleasing slides.
- As a user like an social media influencer, I want to find a minimilistic template for my instagram story highlights, so that it is in theme with my instagram feed.
- As a polytechnic student, I want to download a powerpoint template for my communications project which has the theme of healthcare, so that anyone watching my presentation will know what I will be presenting based on the first slide.
- As a user who works in a company's social media marketing team, I want to find an eye-catching infographic template to clearly present information about the company, so that customers would be attracted to read and give support to the company.
